# **Project Summary**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

The objective of this project is to explore and cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on their attributes such as genres, release year, duration, and ratings.

The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering. In the data preprocessing step, the data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and the data is prepared for further analysis. In the feature engineering step, new features are created from the existing data to better represent the content of the movies and TV shows.

The clustering step involves applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the dataset to group the movies and TV shows into similar clusters. The algorithms used for clustering include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. In this project we will use the first two algorithim.

Once the movies and TV shows are clustered, visualizations such as scatter plots and dendrograms can be used to analyze the clusters and identify patterns and relationships between them. The insights gained from this project can be used to better understand the content available on Netflix and improve the platform's recommendation system.

Overall, this project provides an interesting opportunity to explore the world of Netflix movies and TV shows using data analysis and machine learning techniques.
